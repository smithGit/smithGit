Greetings from Michigan.  I am a retired IT professional continuing to work in information science, realizing a goal from collage to
combine IT and the Humanities (liberal arts degree from Davidson College with Junior Year in Germany, MS in Information Science from Ga Tech in 1969).
I am working in three areas: 
1. "History Explorer" to make date-related information now on the Semantic Web more readily available to the general public.  
- The prototype website for this project is at http://hexplore.azurewebsites.net/#/
- The architecture for this site is Node.js, Vue.js, Quasar framework, Azure SQL
2. The applied ontologies needed to make this informaiton semantically "reasonable."  
- I am pleased to be collaborating on an informal basis with a internationally recognized leader in this field, Dr. Yongqun (Oliver) 
He at the University of Michigan Medical Center
- We are currently working to develop an Occupation Ontology and ultimately a "Life Ontology"
- This ontological work is described on the prototype website at http://hexplore.azurewebsites.net/#/gptopics/gpwhat
3. Using the amazing observablehq.com system for prototyping and augmenting the website information
- Several notebooks are public and the life ontologies concept is in an Observable Collection at https://observablehq.com/collection/@smithgit/life-ontologies
